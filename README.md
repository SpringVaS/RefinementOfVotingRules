# RefinementOfVotingRules

Using Isabelle Monadic Refinement to generate performant code of voting rules.

The voting rules are specified in the Isabelle Framework for Verified Voting Rule Construction (https://github.com/SpringVaS/verifiedVotingRuleConstruction) wich is a fork from (https://github.com/VeriVote/verifiedVotingRuleConstruction).

## Goals

In the afforementioned frameworks, Isabelles' code generation is used to provide verified executable code.
In this project, the Isabelle refinement framework is used to improve the performance of the resulting code with respect to execution times.
